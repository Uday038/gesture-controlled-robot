Gesture recognition can be termed as an approach in this direction. It is the process by which the gestures made by the user are recognized by the receiver. Gestures are expressive, meaningful body motions involving physical movements of the fingers, hands, arms, head, face, or body with the intent of: 

• conveying meaningful information   or 
• interacting with the environment.	

 They constitute one interesting small subspace of possible human motion. A gesture may also be perceived by the environment as a compression technique for the information to be transmitted elsewhere and subsequently reconstructed by the receiver.

This Gesture Recognition methodology has become increasingly popular in a very short span of time. The low moderate cost and relative small size of the accelerometers are the two factors that make it an effective tool to detect and recognize human body gestures. Several studies have been conducted on the recognition of gestures from acceleration data using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) .
